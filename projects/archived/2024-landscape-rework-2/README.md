- **Project tracking issue**: [#302](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues/302)

## Description <!-- description of the project proposal -->

The project reworks the [current TAG ENV landscape document](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/blob/2e6eb079b19911dbd4b219d872a5d8b31fedfb98/website/content/en/landscape/index.md) to provide an overview over the current state of sustainable cloud tech.

1. An introduction of central ideas, concepts, and practices.
2. Anything that goes beyond an introduction should be moved into a separate document, which is then referenced by the landscape document, for further reading,
3. Also highlight not only the achievements and best-practices, which we have and know, but also where we are currently lacking and what we are researching/working on, plus links to how and where to contribute,
    
The document is targeted towards readers with prior knowledge about cloud technology. It should specifically target:
1. Data Center Operators,
2. Cloud Service Providers,
3. Cloud and Software Engineers,
4. Perhaps End Users too.

## Deliverables <!-- deliverables of the project proposal -->
