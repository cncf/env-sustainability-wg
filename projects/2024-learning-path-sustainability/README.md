## Description <!-- description of the project proposal -->

The idea is to craft a comprehensive learning path for everyone new or interested in this topic. It should be the first step in enablement for open source contributors and lead them by pointing out relevant information and educational content.

## Impact <!-- impact of the project proposal -->

Our target is to provide education. Having a starting point on hand to drop for the community will give an initial direction and hopefully make people think about how to apply this in their projects.

## Scope <!-- scope of the project proposal -->

In Scope
- Focusing on how to apply sustainability in your development and projects
- Giving input at which points for a typical oss project energy is wasted


Out of Scope 
- Shouldn't go beyond practical and actually useable approaches
- No re-invention of ESG in general
- Exclude topics that are out of hand of an OSS project

## Goals and Non Goals <!-- goals and non goals of the project proposal -->

The goal is to describe a learning path for the average DevOps/Platform Engineer, who usually has already cloud native systems (containerized environments) in their responsibility.

It's not a goal to build a training, but to put together what can be considered useful and describe the glue between to build a track path.
