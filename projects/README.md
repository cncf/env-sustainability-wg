# Projects

This page lists current TAG projects. Working groups can be found in the [working-groups folder](../working-groups/).
The TAG has a number of smaller initiatives that do not require the formation of a working group.
Projects are not only smaller, but also more scoped and have a clear goal to be achieved once the project is completed.
