# TAG Leadership election process

The leadership team of the TAG (Chairs and TLs) as well as the extended leadership team of working group chairs and project leads are servant leads in the community.
They are an enabler for the group and support the creation and success of the different activities.
They are the driver for the group for not losing the higher targets out of sight and taking decisions when no consensus can be found.

Roles within the TAG outlining expectations and responsibilities are defined in the [roles](roles.md) governance document.

The election process for TAG Leadership is described in the first part of this document.
The election process for Working Group and Project leadership is more lightweight and defined in the second part of this document.

## TAG Chair and TL election process

### Process of nominations for TAG Chair and TL

TAG Lead roles are open to all interested participants within the community.
Depending on the needs of the community, as determined by the current TAG leadership team (Chairs and TLs), nominations may come from working group co-chairs, TAG co-chairs and/or tech leads and/or other community contributors. Each TAG is expected to define this for themselves.

The TAG ENV leadership team is conducted of:

* Three Co-Chairs
* Tech Leads

Final nominations will adhere to the [CNCF's TOC described process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections) as well as to the leadership nomination requirements described below.

Any individual who is a TAG ENV contributor, it's working group's, or otherwise considered an active participant of the group may nominate another individual.

The process of endorsing and selecting individuals will consider the following factors to ensure both the need for proper community representation and the necessary technical expertise:

* Active engagement in the community
* Length of engagement in the community
* Existing body of work
* Justification provided during nomination
* Geo diversity
* Gender diversity
* Company diversity
* Number of nominations from different companies, people, regions for a single individual

In case there are no individuals expressing interest in taking up leadership positions, an evaluation process for the TAG / working group or project archival may be initiated, as [outlined by the TOC](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#retirement).

#### Community timeline for electing TAG Chair and TL

Community nominations will run for at least 1 month, with a maximum up to 2 months.

* For TAG Chair nominations, the TOC will take a vote as [described by the TOC](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections).
* For TAG TL, TAG Chairs will vote and propose the nomination to the TOC. The TOC takes the final vote.
* For Working Group and Project Chairs, the TAG Chairs and Leads will take a vote.

Upon close of nominations, a decision should be made within the next month.

#### Submitting a nomination for TAG Chair and TL

Nominations are to be submitted to [TAG Co-Chair's email alias](mailto:cncf-tag-env-sus-chairs@lists.cncf.io) with the details:

* Subject `"NOMINATION $(TAG Chair, TAG TL, WG XYZ Chair): $NAME-OF-NOMINEE"`
* CC the nominee
* Justification
* Nominee Biography

#### Additional note about the TAG Chair proposal process

1. Environmental Sustainability TAG Co-chairs operate as a team. The Co-Chair team seeks to maintain full coverage of the leadership capabilities across the key qualities of industry experience, hands-on cloud-native and sustainability experience, as well as administrative experience needed to run a Environmental Sustainability TAG.
2. If a clear successor for the exiting Co-Chair exists based on the merit of their contributions ("plant trees, carry water") and relevant experience that will benefit the TAG, based on the TAG's collective experience over time, the exiting Co-chair may nominate a successor to the TOC.
3. The exiting Co-Chair should propose the desired successor to the other Co-Chairs. If there are any objections, the Co-Chair will have the opportunity to propose another worthy candidate. If Environmental Sustainability TAG Chairs, Tech Leads and TOC Liaisons are unable to put forward a candidate, then a selection process will need to be agreed upon and executed.
4. If no new Chair candidate is available, the role will remain vacant until the Co-chair's, TOC Liaisons or CNCF TOC propose a replacement.

### General nomination requirements

The TAG ENV recognizes and values the achievements of individuals who have proven themselves in this community.
If a given nominee does not meet all the requirements, the TAG leadership will still review the nomination and justification to determine if enough intent and commitment is present to move forward with an endorsement.

**Nominees must**:

* Be the author of at least one pull request against the TAG ENV repository
* Be active in the community within the last 3 months before their nomination
  * Engaging in community chat via Slack or lists
  * Commenting on PRs and issues to drive suggestions to proposals, define scope, resolve clarity issues, etc.
* Agree to the nomination

*additional requirements may be defined in the specific [roles](roles.md) governance document*

**Nominations must**:

* Come from someone other than the nominee
* Have justification from the nominator regarding the nominee's capabilities

#### Justification for nominees

To ensure nominations are thoughtful and supported, in addition to the above requirements, a justification must enumerate on the nominee's:

* TAG Community involvement
* Leadership and collaboration skills
* Willingness to learn and expand existing technical knowledge

### Announcing nomination results

The TAG leadership will release aggregate information about the nominees at the end of the nomination process. Aggregate information will not include who nominated someone.

### Next Steps

If the role under nomination requires TOC approval or vote, the TAG Co-chairs are responsible for coordinating and executing that in accordance with the TOC's processes (defined previously).

## Working Group and Project Leadership

Working group and project leads are appointed by the TAG Chairs according to the defined process that's outlined below.

TAG Lead roles are open to all interested participants within the community.
There are currently no limits of leadership roles for working groups or projects if not specified otherwise in the WG / project charter document.

The process of endorsing and selecting individuals will consider the following factors to ensure both the need for proper community representation and the necessary technical expertise:

* Gender diversity
* Company diversity
* Geo diversity
* Number of nominations from different companies, people, regions for a single individual
* Existing body of work
* Justification provided during nomination

In case there are no individuals expressing interest in taking up leadership positions, an evaluation process for the working group or project archival may be initiated, as [working group archival process](project-formation.md).

### Process of nominations for Working Group and Project Leads

Following process should be followed when nominating an individual for Working Group and Project Lead role:

1. One of the TAG Chairs or active Working Group Chairs for the working group lead nomination must open an issue in the [tag-env-sustainability](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues) repository that will be used throughout the election process, including community voting. The issue must include information about the background for the nomination, the role that the individual is being nominated to and clarification on why the respective individual is being nominated into the role. Please refer an earlier [issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues/293) as an example.

2. GitHub issue created in step #1 must be linked in [#tag-environmental-sustainability](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03F270PDU6) channel, which is the main TAG channel, and all relevant sub-channels of the TAG on Slack.

3. Voting period starts. Everyone can vote on the GitHub issue by commenting ```+1``` for support, ```-1``` for block and ```0``` for neutral. Binding flag should be included as part of the comment: ```NB``` for non-binding which applies to all community members and TAG contributors; ```B``` for binding which applies to the TAG Chairs and Tech Leads.

4. Community nominations will run for at least 2 weeks, with a maximum up to 1 month. As soon as all TAG leads vote and at least 2 weeks have passed the TAG Chairs and Tech Leads will take a vote. Upon close of nominations, a decision should be made within the next month.
