# Environmental Sustainability TAG Working Group Chair Proposal Process

TAG Environmental Sustainability Working Group Chairs operate as a team alongside the TAG's co-chairs and technical leads. 
They provide guidance and directions to the working group members and ensure that the working group's efforts are in line with it's mission and values, as well as the overall goals of the TAG. They facilitate the working group's activities and coordinate its members' efforts. They schedule working group meetings, set meeting agenda, and maintain effective communication to ensure smooth collaboration among the working group's participants.
Finally, they provide regular updates to the TAG, keeping the TAG leadership team and members informed about the group's progress and deliverables.

## Caveats of Working Group Chairs

* The position of a working group chair is not a paid position (TAG co-chairs and tech leads are also not paid positions)
* Working group Chairs [have responsibilities](roles.md) to the Environmental Sustainability TAG, the leadership team, and the TOC
* Nominations made by the community, need endorsements by 1 or more working group/TAG co-chairs, or tech leads

## Process of nominations

Depending on the needs of the community, as determined by the Environmental Sustainability TAG leadership team, working group chair nominations may come in the form of "Nominees by community", "Nominees by working group co-chairs", "Nominees by TAG co-chairs" or all of them.

The Environmental Sustainability TAG does not have a current limit on the amount of working group chairs.

Final working group chair nominations will adhere to the [CNCF's TOC described process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections).

Nominees should adhere to the working group chair nomination requirements described below.
Any individual who is a member of the Environmental Sustainability TAG list or the tag-environmental-sustainability slack channel may nominate another individual.

The working group co-chairs reserve the right to endorse a nominee by the community based on:

* Gender diversity
* Company diversity
* Geo diversity
* Amount of nominations from different companies, people, regions for a single individual
* Existing body of work
* Justification provided during nomination

#### Community timeline

Community nominations will run for at least 1 month with a maximum up to 2 months.
Upon close of nominations a decision will be made by the working group co-chairs within the next month.

#### Submitting a nomination

Nominations are to be submitted to [Environmental Sustainability TAG Co-Chairs email alias](mailto:cncf-tag-env-sus-chairs@lists.cncf.io) with the details:

* Subject "Working Group $NAME-OF-WORKING-GROUP chair nomination: $NAME-OF-NOMINEE"
* CC the nominee
* Justification

#### Endorsement of community nominees

Working group co-chairs are responsible for providing endorsement of a community nominee to show concurrence and support.

If no nominees are submitted by the community or from working group/TAG co-chairs, either as a result of lack of participation or lack of requirements, the working group co-chairs must endeavor to nominate an individual(s) that meet as many of the requirements as exist.

## Working Group Chair nomination requirements

In order to verify nominees by the community or by working group/TAG co-chairs have experience with the group and are actively contributing in a meaningful way, the following requirements must be met in order for an individual to be nominated.
At TAG Environmental Sustainability, we maintain a meritocracy in which we recognize and value the achievements of individuals who have proven themselves in this community.

If a given nominee does not meet all the requirements, the working group co-chairs will still review the nomination and justification to determine if enough intent and commitment is present to move forward with an endorsement.

Nominees must:
* be the author of at least one pull request against the Environmental Sustainability TAG repository
* be active in the community within the last 3 months prior to their nomination
   * active - Attending at least 1 Environmental Sustainability TAG Regular Meeting a month
   * engaging in community chat via slack or lists
   * commenting on PRs and issues to drive suggestions to proposals, define scope, resolve clarity issues, etc.
* agree to the nomination

Nominations must:

* come from someone other than the nominee
* have justification from the nominator regarding the nominee's capabilities

### Justification for nominees

To ensure nominations are thoughtful and supported, in addition to the above requirements, a justification must enumerate on the nominee's:

* TAG Community involvement
* leadership and collaboration skills
* willingness to learn and expand existing technical knowledge

## Announcing nomination results

The working group co-chairs will release aggregate information about the nominees at the end of the nomination process. Aggregate information will not include who nominated someone.
