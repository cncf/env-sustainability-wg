# TAG Environmental Sustainability Leadership Team

The leadership team of the TAG are servant leads.
They are an enabler for the group and support the creation and success of the different activities.
They are the driver for the group for not losing the higher targets out of sight and taking decisions when no consensus can be found.

## Team Structure

The leadership team is conducted of:

* Three Co-Chairs
* Tech Leads

As a TAG in the CNCF, we strive to serve the Cloud Native community, and so it is especially important to allow everyone to contribute and to create as diverse a group as possible.

## Proposal Process

### Environmental Sustainability TAG Chair proposal process

1. Environmental Sustainability TAG Co-chairs operate as a team. The Co-Chair team seeks to maintain full coverage of the leadership capabilities across the key qualities of industry experience, hands-on cloud-native and sustainability experience, as well as administrative experience needed to run a Environmental Sustainability TAG.
2. If a clear successor for the exiting Co-Chair exists based on the merit of their contributions ("plant trees, carry water") and relevant experience that will benefit the TAG, based on the TAG's collective experience over time, the exiting Co-chair may nominate a successor to the TOC.
3. The exiting Co-Chair should propose the desired successor to the other Co-Chairs. If there are any objections, the Co-Chair will have the opportunity to propose another worthy candidate. If Environmental Sustainability TAG Chairs, Tech Leads and TOC Liaisons are unable to put forward a candidate, then a selection process will need to be agreed upon and executed.
4. If no new Chair candidate is available, the role will remain vacant until the Co-chair's, TOC Liaisons or CNCF TOC propose a replacement.
