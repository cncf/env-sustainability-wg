## Working Group or Project creation

### Discuss the Working Group or Project idea in the community

To discuss the project or working group follow the [process](process.md).
After the project has been discussed and should be followed up, the contributors need to work on a charter document.

### How to write a charter document

The following structure should be used to write the charter document.
The charter inherits the TAG ENV charter and should not be repeated.
You can browse existing charter documents for [working-groups here](../working-groups/).

1. **Title and Introduction**: Start with a brief introduction that states the purpose of the document. Mention the project's affiliation, purpose and role under the TAG ENV.
2. **Motivation**: Explain the reasons behind forming the project. Describe the challenges, objectives, and goals it aims to address. Make it clear why the project is necessary and how it supports the broader mission of its parent organization.
3. **Scope**: Define the boundaries of the project's responsibilities. Clearly state what the project will and will not do.
4. **Goals**: List the specific objectives that the project aims to achieve. These should be measurable and related to the overall purpose of the group. Ensure that your goals are aligned with the motivation and scope of the group.
5. **Non-Goals**: Highlight what the project will not do. These are activities or responsibilities that are outside the group's scope. It's important to make these non-goals explicit to avoid misunderstandings and scope creep.
6. **Deliverables**: Detail what the project will produce or accomplish. Be specific about the expected outcomes and any documentation, tools, or processes that will be created.

### Finding Leads

To start the working group and project, contributor need to take ownership.
Roles are described in the [roles](roles.md) document.

* A working group needs to have two or three Chairs. Working group tech leads can be added additionally.
* A project needs to have one or more project leads.

How these leads get elected are defined in the [lead election](lead-proposal-process.md) document

### Start the Working Group or Project

To start the working group or project open a PR to propose adding the charter document to the TAG repository.
The PR should also update the website and other parts of the repository to record the project accordingly.
This [PR](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/pull/151) serves as an example.

## Working Group or Project archival

Evaluation process for working group archival will follow the guidelines, as outlined below:

* **Purpose and Relevance Review:** A review of the working group's initial purpose and its relevance in the current context will be conducted to determine whether the group's objectives have been achieved or remain essential for the community. If there are specific objectives that can be integrated into the scope of other working groups that exist within the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) or fall under the overall TAG's objectives, necessary efforts will be made to facilitate the transition of such objectives.
* **Community Engagement and Feedback:** Transparent communication and engagement with working group contributors as well as TAG contributors will be initiated to seek their feedback and opinions on the potential working group archival decision. This inclusive approach ensures that community interests and perspectives are considered.
* **Documentation:** Detailed documentation of discussions and the rationale for the working group archival decision will be recorded, preserving historical context and providing clarity on the decision-making process.
* **Public Announcement:** In the event that the working group is considered for archival, a public announcement will be made to communicate the decision and its underlying reasons to the wider community. This announcement aims to prevent any confusion and foster transparency.
* **Evaluation Period:** To ensure adaptability, a designated evaluation period may be specified, allowing for reevaluation of the working group archival decision if future changes in project needs or community dynamics arise.
* **Approval by TOC:** After reaching an agreement and alignment from the working group and TAG contributors, the working group archival decision will be submitted to the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) for approval. Upon receiving approval from the TOC, the working group will be formally archived, and the archival process will be finalized.
