## Process for creating new Slack channels

All Slack channels must be created in the [CNCF](https://slack.cncf.io) workspace. TAG ENV has a main channel [#tag-environmental-sustainability](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03F270PDU6) with complementary sub-channels for some working groups or projects. The goal is to always provide the main channel with meaningful information, even if a sub-channel exists. This should be done by posting the message in the main channel and posting a link to the message in the sub-channel.

If a new Slack channel must be created, please ensure that following steps are followed as part of the process:

* The channel gets created in the [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io) workspace
* At least one of the [TAG ENV Leads](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability#tag-environmental-sustainability-co-chairs) has approved creation of the new channel
* TAG ENV meeting notes are updated with the link to the new Slack channel. If the channel is related to the working group, meeting notes for the respective WG are also updated
* Contact information on GitHub and TAG ENV website is updated with the link to the new channel
* Announcement of the new channel is posted on main [#tag-environmental-sustainability](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03F270PDU6) channel

After the new channel is created please ensure that all the larger announcements and bigger conversations are still cross-posted in the main [#tag-environmental-sustainability](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03F270PDU6) channel.
