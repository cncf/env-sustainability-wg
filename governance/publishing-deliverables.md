# Guidance on Publishing and Delivering Artifacts

As part of regular business of TAG Environmental Sustainability, we publish several artifacts as deliverables coming out of different projects.
The following guide is intended to help future project leads to deliver their artifacts by learning from past experiences of delivering such artifacts.

## Using GitHub Issues to Track Progress

All deliverables need a single place where, anyone can go to:

- Express interest in collaborating on it
- Find the current status of the deliverable
- Find the timelines of publication
- Find the steps remaining before publication
- Find the tasks that are part of the deliverable

All of this can be described well in a GitHub Issue.
Also, because the GitHub issue description can be edited, it allows us to keep adding more information, updating project status can be done without changing the place everyone can go, to find out what they want to know.

## Identifying External Dependencies

When working on multi-person, multi-month project, it is imperative to recognize external dependencies for whom this may not be the highest priority task they will work on.
In case of our group's deliverables, these dependencies can be CNCF Service Desk folks, Design team who generates PDF version of markdown files, TOC reviewers i.e. Environmental Sustainability TAG liaisons.

Acknowledging this prioritization gap, to meet the timelines of the deliverable, it is important to start earlier than you think is necessary so that there is enough buffer time for all the unforeseen circumstances that may delay things.
[Paper process guide](paper-process.md) has a recommended timeline that you can use to get started and adjust as needed.

Working during a pandemic and several global unprecedented events, has also meant that some unknown events could delay deliverables.
In such situations, instead of pushing for working on the deliverables, it is important to show grace and recognize that people might be dealing with significantly more important things than your deliverable.
In such situations, reassessing deadlines, scope and finding temporary replacements who can contribute for folks who are busy, helps unblock the progress of the deliverable.

## Get Help from CNCF Service Desk

The CNCF has excellent people who can help out on making your deliverable shine through:

* Professionally designed PDF from your markdown content
* Animation, Graphics, Diagrams that represent important aspects of the
  deliverable
* Blog posts that summarize and introduce your deliverable
* Social media outreach of your deliverable via Twitter, LinkedIn

Additionally, publishing an artifact during or just before KubeCon allows us to share the publication announcement widely in different forums.
The TAG Co-Chairs have access to the Service Desk.

## Define Stages of Publication

Each Deliverable can go through several stages from inception to publication.
Treating this process like a project with milestones allows folks as well as the lead to understand if timely progress is being made or not â€” in addition to identifying a milestone lead for very large or complex projects.

## Write a Blog

The blog post process is defined in the [blogpost-process.md](blogpost-process.md) file.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Every human being is prone to mistakes.
So the intent of this section is to help avoid making the same mistakes as past project leads so that you can make newer mistakes and update this section with your experiences.

* **Not reviewing the artifact for brevity, correctness and flow**: Project leads should attempt to review the artifact a minimum of 2-3 times with a different goal for each review
* **Missing names of contributors or reviewers of the paper**: Double check if the contributors or reviewers are missing in the PDF or markdown and cross-check with GitHub issue assignees who worked on the tasks for the deliverables.
* **Engaging with CNCF too close to publication date**: CNCF service desk probably gets a lot of requests for help close to KubeCon. Engaging them very early with a service desk ticket allows you to make progress early and creates higher chance of the deliverable being published on time.

## Sharing Far and Wide

Publishing the artifact has little benefit if it does not reach the intended audiences.
So seek help from CNCF, Co-chairs, Tech Leads of TAG Environmental Sustainability to share the artifact through their networks. Encourage contributors and reviewers to share the artifact to their networks as well.
Make use of CNCF mailing lists during Request for Comment stage and after publication to share useful anecdotes about the deliverable followed by a "Call to Action".

## Take Ownership and Give Credit

Person leading a project to deliver an artifact is playing this role **in service of the community**.
So taking ownership of delays, feedback, push-back and mistakes made in the artifact is vital and important for community to feel heard, valued and contributors to feel safe.

At the same time, it is equally important to give credit to all the contributors and reviewers for their splendid work especially keeping in mind that most folks carved time out of their busy schedules to share their valuable input.

The deliverable is a _community driven effort_ without the community it was not possible, keep this in mind as you continue to lead future projects.

Finally, as a project lead you should plan for a break after publication of the deliverable for unwinding, self-care and as a gift to yourself and others for the hard work of pulling this together over several months.
Once you are back though, make sure to give this a read and update as needed based on your experiences so others may benefit from it :)
