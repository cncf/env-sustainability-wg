# Environmental Sustainability TAG Working Group Archival Process

Working group co-chairs are responsible for providing endorsement of a community nominee to show concurrence and support.

If no nominees are submitted by the community and/or working group/TAG co-chairs or tech leads, either as a result of lack of participation or lack of requirements, the working group co-chairs must endeavor to nominate an individual(s) that meet as many of the requirements as exist.

However, should there be a situation where there are still no individuals expressing interest in taking up leadership positions within the working group, an evaluation process for working group archival will be initiated.

## Working Group archival process guidelines

Evaluation process for working group archival will follow the guidelines, as outlined below:

* **Purpose and Relevance Review:** A review of the working group's initial purpose and its relevance in the current context will be conducted to determine whether the group's objectives have been achieved or remain essential for the community. If there are specific objectives that can be integrated into the scope of other working groups that exist within the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) or fall under the overall TAG's objectives, necessary efforts will be made to facilitate the transition of such objectives.
* **Community Engagement and Feedback:** Transparent communication and engagement with working group members as well as TAG members will be initiated to seek their feedback and opinions on the potential working group archival decision. This inclusive approach ensures that community interests and perspectives are considered.
* **Documentation:** Detailed documentation of discussions and the rationale for the working group archival decision will be recorded, preserving historical context and providing clarity on the decision-making process.
* **Public Announcement:** In the event that the working group is considered for archival, a public announcement will be made to communicate the decision and its underlying reasons to the wider community. This announcement aims to prevent any confusion and foster transparency.
* **Evaluation Period:** To ensure adaptability, a designated evaluation period may be specified, allowing for reevaluation of the working group archival decision if future changes in project needs or community dynamics arise.
* **Approval by TOC:** After reaching an agreement and alignment from the working group and TAG members, the working group archival decision will be submitted to the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) for approval. Upon receiving approval from the TOC, the working group will be formally archived, and the archival process will be finalized.
