# Outlining your Contributor Path

The CNCF Environmental Sustainability TAG aims to support individuals who are passionate about cloud native sustainability and provide a space for personal growth as contributors.
This document outlines a path for advancing as a contributor in the TAG. 
It's important to note that your journey may not precisely align with this path, as the document serves as a general guide.
If you have already made significant contributions to another TAG or a project within the CNCF landscape and are familiar with the community, your path will naturally differ from that of someone who is just starting out.

## Starting out

When venturing into the open source space, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the way we operate and collaborate as a global community.
Take some time to reflect on your personal journey.
Find out if you genuinely derive joy from this line of work and consider what areas of knowledge you are particularly curious about.
Remember, actively participating and providing valuable input are significant aspects of your involvement in the community.
By engaging with others and sharing your insights, you contribute to the collective growth and success of the open source ecosystem.

To begin, consider taking ownership of a small initiative within the TAG, such as opening an issue that was discussed during a meeting, or taking on responsibilities like reviewing pull requests (PRs).
Additionally, you can contribute by raising awareness about the TAG ENV among your network. This can involve sharing information and updates, presenting talks at conferences or events, organizing meetups, or even writing a blog post (refer to [blog post process](blogpost-process.md) for guidance).
Collaboration with other organizations is also a priority for us, so actively seeking out open source projects or organizations you know in the cloud native sustainability space and connecting them with the TAG would be highly valuable.

Modeling empathy and offering support to the community as a whole should be at the forefront of your actions.
It is crucial to embody the values of the community as outlined in the [code of conduct](http://cncf.io/conduct/).

There are various ways you can contribute to supporting and empowering new contributors.
Firstly, you can actively participate by stepping in and offering mentorship and guidance when someone requires assistance. This could involve helping them navigate the community, providing technical guidance, or answering their questions.
Additionally, if a member is unable to fulfill their responsibilities, you can offer to fill in their role temporarily or assist in any necessary tasks.
Co-hosting meetups and events is another way to provide support. By sharing the responsibility, you help create an inclusive environment where everyone feels supported and encouraged.

Lastly, building a habit of consistently helping out within the TAG is highly valuable.
This can include engaging in discussions, providing feedback on proposals, reviewing code contributions, or offering assistance in any way that aligns with your skills and expertise.
By actively participating and contributing, you demonstrate your commitment to the community and showcase the values that the Environmental Sustainability TAG holds dear.
