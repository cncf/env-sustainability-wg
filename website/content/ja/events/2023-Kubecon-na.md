The Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s flagship conference gathers adopters and technologists from leading open source and cloud native communities for the second time in 2023. This time KubeCon+CloudNativeCon event takes place in the windy city of Chicago, USA from 6-9 November, 2023. Both us from the TAG will be delivering a few sessions on-site, and there will be multiple sustainability-related sessions from other community members that we would like to highlight here!

We are looking forward to hearing your perspectives and welcome everyone who wants to contribute to our efforts in the cloud native sustainability space.
Let’s reduce the environmental sustainability footprint of the cloud, data centers and CNCF projects together.
