If you are reading this blog it might be that you are interested in contributing to the cloud native sustainability domain. This blog will help you and guide you through the different possibilities that are available for you, like joining the **The Technical Advisory Group** Environmental Sustainability, or one of its associated working groups.

Starting to contribute to open source and cloud native communities may often seem challenging and scary for beginners, but there are many ways you can embark on this journey. One way to engage with the community is to contribute to one of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation Technical Advisory Groups (CNCF TAG).

The **TAG ENV**, consists of individuals that focus on a specific area of the CNCF landscape by providing guidance, addressing challenges from the community and establishing domain-specific standards and best practices.

If you are curious about the TAG and play with the ideas to contribute you likely ask yourself the following questions.

- What are the goals of the TAG ENV and how do they work with each other?
- How does my contribution help with sustainability efforts?
- Which projects does the TAG ENV has and how can I contribute to them?
- How can I share ideas, improvements and any other suggestions to the TAG ENV?

## Introducing the CNCF TAG Environmental Sustainability

The **TAG ENV** operates as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) alongside several other [TAGs](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/tags#current-tags).

Drawing inspiration from international frameworks such as the Paris Climate Accords, the TAG ENV sets out with a clear agenda: work with the cloud native community to tackle global environmental challenges by identifying ways to reduce the environmental footprint of steadily growing data centers and expanding the cloud native technologies landscape.

You can find more information about the TAG ENV’s mission in the [charter document](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/blob/main/charter.md).

The primary goals of the TAG ENV are:

- Identify, define, and support existing (or develop minimal) tooling to assess and refine environmental sustainability approaches.
- Quantify the energy consumption of individual cloud native applications and their typical integration patterns.
- Recommend energy-efficient strategies for the entire lifecycle of cloud native applications, from development to deployment and operation.
- Collaborate with other environmental or sustainability entities, even those outside of CNCF's purview.

If the TAG’s goals resonate with your own,keep on reading to learn more about why YOU should  join the TAG and how to get involved.

## TAG Environmental Sustainability needs YOU - but WHY?

Open source transcends mere lines of code; it epitomizes a global collaboration uniting individuals worldwide to craft free and accessible software.
By integrating technical and environmental considerations, the TAG ENV engages in a diverse array of cloud native projects.
Our commitment lies in transforming concepts into tangible initiatives that positively impact both the environment and the tech industry.

**1. Why should you contribute to open source?**

Getting involved in open source is an incredible way to collaborate with diverse individuals worldwide to develop free and accessible software.
It's an opportunity to contribute to innovative projects, share valuable insights, and nurture successful initiatives while learning from a vibrant community of developers and enthusiasts.

**2. Why should you contribute to the cloud native sustainability domain?**

At TAG Environmental Sustainability, we thrive on collaboration by connecting you with CNCF projects, including [working groups](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/tree/main/working-groups) and [projects](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/blob/main/projects/README.md), to create innovative solutions for a greener tech future.
We serve as a knowledge hub for sharing insights and fostering eco-friendly innovations. Your contributions help nurture successful open source projects focused on sustainability.
We provide resources and support, ensuring you don't have to start from scratch.
[TAG ENV](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/blob/main/charter.md), as a [Technical Advisory Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/tags), collaborates with the open source community, working towards defining environmental sustainability factors for the cloud native landscape.
Our mission includes incubating open source projects to measure and reduce carbon footprints in cloud native infrastructure.
We aim to raise awareness of environmental sustainability in open source and support projects that promote energy-efficient solutions, positively impacting the community.

## Can YOU help shape the future of the TAG Environmental Sustainability?

Yes! The TAG ENV is a community-driven group, and everyone's input is highly valued and appreciated. If you have an idea that you would like to propose to the TAG ENV, the first step is to check if this idea already exists as a project or otherwise. You can check the [issues](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues) page for closed and open issues where you discuss your idea or reopen an old discussion.

Scope your idea and refer to the first-time contributors quick start from our [contributor guide](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#first-time-contributors). It is advisable to refer to the [governance folder](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/tree/main/governance) to get a better understanding of different processes in the TAG.

Your idea can be phrased in the form of a detailed proposal, a blog post, or even a presentation. It may be a message in Slack or a GitHub issue. You can write a full-fledged proposal from the beginning and once your idea is documented, you can  share it with the group in [#tag-environmental-sustainability](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03F270PDU6) channel on [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03F270PDU6), where the TAG actively discusses new ideas.

Another way to bring your proposals to the TAG ENV community is by participating in TAG's working groups. These are groups of experts and enthusiasts who focus on specific topics, such as performing sustainability footprint reviews of CNCF projects or driving marketing and communication.

By joining one of the working groups, you can collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to ongoing discussions and projects. Working groups are an excellent opportunity to receive feedback on your proposals and work collaboratively to bring them to fruition.

To ensure that your contributions are in line with TAG's standards and expectations, TAG has a "Contribute" section on the website, which provides detailed information on how to get involved and contribute to different areas of the organization. It also includes a technical guide that outlines TAG's technical specifications and guidelines for creating documentation and code.

The TAG ENV community encourages and welcomes contributions from anyone. If you have an idea that you believe can make a positive impact on the industry, don't hesitate to share it with the TAG ENV community. Together, we can shape the idea into something actionable for the benefit of the TAG and the cloud native community as a whole.
