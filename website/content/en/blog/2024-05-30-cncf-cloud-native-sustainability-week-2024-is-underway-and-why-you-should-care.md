## Uniting Technology and Sustainability for a Brighter Future

In our modern world, technology and sustainability can harmoniously coexist, creating a brighter future. Each of us can contribute to this by adopting innovative and eco-friendly practices. CNCF Cloud Native Sustainability Week provides a forum and a unique opportunity to reflect on how we can evolve and innovate together, sustainably.

After the successful 2023 edition of the event, planning for this year's edition is already underway, with a renewed commitment to increasingly green and engaging initiatives.

But let's start from the beginning.

### What is CNCF Cloud Native Sustainability Week?

The CNCF Sustainability Week is an annual event that is organized by the CNCF Technical Advisory Group for Environmental Sustainability (TAG ENV) in collaboration with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The main goal of the event is to promote environmental sustainability in the cloud native industry and open source space.

This global event, which includes both in-person meet-ups and virtual sessions, is organized by local tech communities around the world and coordinated by the TAG ENV. We believe that by encouraging such global intercontinental collaboration, we can enable people from all over the globe to understand how sustainability is an integral factor in the technology sector and how, sometimes with very little, technological and innovative initiatives can be carried out while respecting the environment.

Before delving into the details around CNCF Cloud Native Sustainability Week, let's take a look at what the CNCF TAG ENV is. 

## Introducing CNCF Technical Advisory Group for Environmental Sustainability (TAG ENV)

The CNCF TAG ENV is a Technical Advisory Group that’s driven by passionate individuals who are committed to developing guidelines, tools, and practices to integrate sustainability into cloud native technologies. Its main purpose is to share tools and best practices to reduce the environmental impact of technological infrastructures, proposing innovative strategies and practical solutions.

TAG ENV regularly organizes meetings, including initiatives such as promoting Cloud Native Sustainability Week 2024. TAG ENV is an open group, and anyone wishing to contribute and actively participate in the group and its activities can do so. The group is focused on transparency, inclusion and active collaboration between its contributors that sparks innovation and creates further opportunities to contribute to a more sustainable cloud native and open source space.

If you would like to join TAG ENV,  participate in discussions, and contribute to the groups activities like planning the Cloud Native Sustainability Week, you can join the CNCF Slack channel, [#tag-environmental-sustainability](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03F270PDU6), attend regular TAG ENV [meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=72e93a411f02e5664bb4485c04311b83dae6a62574e4ab882a1ccf8526aa9bf1%40group.calendar.google.com), or collaborate together with other contributors on the TAG ENV [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues). Last year we wrote a [blog post that does a deep-dive into how you can start contributing to the TAG ENV](https://tag-env-sustainability.cncf.io/blog/2023-getting-started-as-tag-env-contributor), and if it sounds interesting then we encourage you to check it out for more details!

New contributors are always welcome and we would love to have YOU join us! Every contribution, big or small, can make a difference in realizing a greener and more sustainable technological future.
