## TAG [Talk](https://sched.co/1hovS)

The carbon must be counted. In the Environmental Sustainability TAG, we focus on current and emerging technologies regarding carbon measurement and minimization. As our digital landscape grows, so does its impact on the environment‚Äîa factor often overlooked in the pursuit of technological advancement, such as AI. Traditionally, companies focused primarily on financial metrics. However, with increasing awareness of climate issues, stricter regulations, and rising energy costs, environmental impact is now a crucial consideration. We highlight the Green Reviews Working Group and our project to measure impact. We're developing a pipeline that works with current tooling, such as Kepler, to measure the power consumption of CNCF Projects. We explore how to measure energy consumption and emissions of software projects. We also give the status of other projects, such as the sustainability landscape, initiatives such as our sustainability week, and collaborative organisations.
