TAG Environmental Sustainability has working groups and teams to effectively collaborate and coordinate efforts towards achieving common goals and objectives, as well as to distribute tasks and responsibilities among its contributors for efficient execution. This approach allows for a more streamlined and organized approach to managing complex projects within the CNCF ecosystem. You can read more about the intention of working groups and the overall process behind submitting a working group proposal on the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) GitHub: [CNCF Working Groups](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/workinggroups/README.md).

Following working groups operate under the TAG Environmental Sustainability:
