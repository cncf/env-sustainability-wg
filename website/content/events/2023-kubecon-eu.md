Are you interested in the impact your cloud projects and cloud-related work has on the environment?
Then we would love to meet you at our [**TAG Environmental Sustainability Project Meeting**](https://sched.co/1JWOX) at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2023.
We have some exiting presentations and discussions planned.
We are looking forward to hearing your perspectives and welcome everyone who wants to contribute to our effort.
Let’s reduce the environmental of the cloud, data centers and our projects.

In the talk we will talk about the latest from the CNCF Environmental Sustainability TAG. We’ll focus on the findings exploring the Cloud Native Sustainability landscape, the landscape of organizations that we collaborate with! We highlight current bottlenecks and challenges and provide guidance and opportunities to contribute to sustainability yourself. We will introduce you to cloud native projects that you can use today to build your tech stack a little more sustainable.
