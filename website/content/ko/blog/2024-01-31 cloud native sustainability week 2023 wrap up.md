For the first time, during the week 9th-15th October 2023, [CNCF TAG Environmental Sustainability](https://tag-env-sustainability.cncf.io/) organized a global community event that was aimed to raise awareness for and share knowledge about the topic of cloud native sustainability ‚Äì [Cloud Native Sustainability Week](https://tag-env-sustainability.cncf.io/events/cloud-native-sustainability-week/). When we started planning the event we didn‚Äôt expect that there would be so much interest and willingness to help in organizing the event from the community, but the engagement and involvement have been overwhelming and we‚Äôre extremely grateful for that!

Throughout the week we had **5** live streams, **1** global virtual mini conference, **5** blog posts and **12** local meetups. But the involvement didn‚Äôt just stop after that week: countless social media posts and content references were spread by the global tech community in addition to 10 more local meetups that were organized shortly after the main week of the event. In total the event took place in **17** countries spread across **4** continents ‚Äì if that can‚Äôt be called a stunning success, what can?üòÉ

The Cloud Native Sustainability Week became a forum where community members share knowledge and reflections, participate in engaging discussions and look into potential actions and approaches for improving sustainability posture of cloud native and open source space. It‚Äôs an event that brings together like-minded individuals with different backgrounds, but with the same passion in common, which is sustainability.

We believe that with the collaborative approach that Cloud Native Sustainability Week provides the grounds for, attendees will be empowered and inspired to contribute to the future development of cloud native sustainability domain and the TAG ENV itself. Together we can shape the sustainability posture of the projects within the cloud native and open source realm, which will add up to other global actions for the better of our planet and future generations.

## Insights from the attendee survey

With 22 meetups, hosting over a thousand in-person attendees and thousands online, we had an opportunity to get insight into the community‚Äôs views on sustainability, their level of awareness, ideas and actions that are gaining traction. We gathered data through an attendee survey with 86 responses.

It is important to paint a realistic landscape of the community‚Äôs concerns. A few voices expressed disbelief in sustainability being taken seriously by large players in the IT industry. Although not a popular sentiment in our respondents, it underlines the critical importance of transparency and data in order to not risk falling into the trap of green washing.

Most attendees considered the content of our sessions to be effective in helping them understand what cloud native sustainability is. Attendees valued the work that‚Äôs being put into raising awareness on the need for sustainable practices in the cloud native landscape. Given that the majority also stated that they are very likely to apply the knowledge from our sessions in their projects, we can be somewhat confident that a mix of informative and hands-on sessions is a good recipe for future events, especially when sessions are interactive ‚Äì our attendees are eager to discuss ideas and particular use-cases.

We asked people: *What was the most interesting insight that you have gained from the events you‚Äôve attended so far that enhanced your understanding of cloud native sustainability?* The answers can be divided into a few categories. Most answers revolved around collecting data, raising awareness of sustainable practices, and adopting concrete tools to run more sustainable IT operations in the cloud.

Our attendees are aware that data collection on energy consumption and the actual carbon footprint of applications is crucial, and they signal the need for transparency from cloud providers on that front (*Difficulty getting accurate carbon footprint information from energy/IT providers*, to quote one respondent).

Our attendees also recognize *the role that developers have in reducing the carbon footprint of cloud technologies*. Thus, the responsibility for sustainable practices falls not just on the cloud providers, but also on their customers, who should *consider ‚Äúgreen‚Äù as an important priority* when planning and developing new products. They mention technologies like [Kepler](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler), [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/), [Leafcloud](https://www.leaf.cloud/), and [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre) as areas of interest.

A common challenge to adopting tools to collect data on carbon intensity and acting on them is IT strategy and knowledge gaps (17 responses each) on the one hand, and time and budget constraints (14 and 11 responses, respectively) on the other. This highlights the need for being efficient in communication around sustainability since most organizations have pressing priorities already, while at the same time being aware of the risks of oversimplification.

## Embracing a global community

The Cloud Native Sustainability Week 2023 was an exemplary demonstration of how a global community can come together around a common goal. The event featured meetups in 17 countries and an online gathering that reached people from every corner of the world, showcasing its international reach and shared commitment to sustainability in the cloud. This collective effort highlighted the power of a united and forward-looking community.

The combination of physical and virtual meetings created a powerful sense of a global community, united by a common goal: promoting sustainability in the cloud sector.

To reflect the scope and energy of these meetings, we have compiled a collage of photos showcasing a few images from some of the meetups around the world. These photos represent not only the highlights and meaningful interactions but also the diversity and enthusiasm of the participants. Each image is a testament to the vibrancy and commitment of our community towards sustainability üíö.

The Cloud Native Sustainability Week highlighted just how strong and dedicated our global community is. Every meetup, every online session, every shared photo is a piece of this vast mosaic of individuals and groups working together for a more sustainable future. This week of events was a clear demonstration of how, when united by a common goal, we can overcome geographical and cultural barriers to make a difference.

Looking ahead, the success of the Cloud Native Sustainability Week 2023 is an exciting starting point for further initiatives. We will continue to build this global community, drawing inspiration from this year‚Äôs successes and expanding our commitment to making the cloud native world increasingly sustainable.
