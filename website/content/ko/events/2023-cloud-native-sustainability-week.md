The CNCF Global Week of Cloud Native Sustainability is an event organized by the [CNCF TAG Environmental Sustainability](http://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability) and the wider [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) community](http://cncf.io) to address the emerging topic of environmental sustainability in the cloud native industry and open source space. The event aims to engage with the community and IT industry as a whole, get a better understanding of the current environmental sustainability landscape, and promote collaboration and knowledge sharing on the topic.

During the **second week of October 2023 (W41)**, the [CNCF community groups around the globe](https://community.cncf.io/chapters/) will organize meetups in their cities with a focus on cloud native sustainability. These meetups can be organized by anyone interested in supporting the effort. Additionally, the [CNCF Environmental Sustainability Technical Advisory Group (TAG ENV)](http://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability), will host a virtual meetup. The recordings of the virtual and recorded in person event will be uploaded to this [playlist on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_3_oSSuNpD4cdUFtW68Ejl5FpD7fEFdg&si=iBEY_qa1-DccqWz_).
