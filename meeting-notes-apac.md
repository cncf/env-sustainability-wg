## How This Meeting Works

This GitHub Readme is open for edit. We encourage suggestions for upcoming meeting topics. If there are none 24 hours before the meeting, we may propose canceling on our Slack channel and mailing list.

Action Items recorded in the meeting will be turned into GitHub issues and assigned to the [TAG project board](https://github.com/orgs/cncf/projects/10). The meeting is recorded and posted to our YouTube Playlist before the end of the week. A host moderates the meeting, and we encourage hand-raising instead of interrupting.

    - [Kepler team](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler-metal-ci) [Green Review WG](https://github.com/cncf-tags/green-reviews-tooling/tree/main)
      UPDATE - for reuse with kepler CI, we had a discussion in slack, but it seems kepler's CI is on fundamental level, progress level... some difference with TAG's CI, let's see how to reuse them in the feature?
      Setup everything from zero - including Kubernetes
      TAG - already have a Kubernetes cluster
      workload orcehstration - Github repo and Tekton(this can be reused by other projects eg Istio)
      Kepler has its own set of workload and TAG has their own workload orchestration.
      TAG Green reviews and Kepler agree to do some implementation in CI like dashboard or metrics or functionality or calculation.
      Suggestion - Can we write up a post on how the Kepler CI is being done (Saiyam): First the kepler community will focus on creating a sample repo with pipelines(tekton based) that start from zero with all steps to replicate it for projects and then to put that in a blog. Also to propose this to mentor.mentee program is in thoughts, Also opn for suggestions and discussions. Kepler to validate Kelper itself is the first goal to be achieved! accuracy and kepler CI demos
