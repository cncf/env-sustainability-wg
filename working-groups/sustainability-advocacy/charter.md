# Sustainability Advocacy Working Group Charter

## Motivation

Marketing is as crucial as code to any open source project’s success. Participation in open source projects play a vital role in developing a sustainable ecosystem around a project by marketing the project through their networks. The key is to promote the project first and always remain authentic and true to the open source ethos of openness and transparency.

The Sustainability Advocacy Working Group is part of the CNCF Environmental Sustainability Technical Advisory Group (TAG ENV) to help organize communication and marketing efforts.

The Sustainability Advocacy Working Group has its main focus on the marketing communications, public and member relations of the TAG. It provides member-neutral contribution, ecosystem development and marketing services, collaborative management, branding and compatibility.

## Governance
<!-- cSpell:ignore subteam, subteams -->
The Communications Working Group extends the [TAG ENV governance](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/tree/main/governance) by community roles to better delegate tasks across the community. The roles are inspired by the [Kubernetes communications team](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication/contributor-comms/role-handbooks). The group defines the areas of its work, such as social media, blogging, etc. and creates associated subproject Tech Lead (TL) leadership roles accordingly. Any contributors are encouraged to pursue interest in subteams as contributing team members or as elected TL. General subproject leadership tasks and reporting to the Communications Working Group is handled by the subproject TL. The rotation of a subproject lead is to be coordinated with the Communications Working Group Leadership. Roles can rotate across contributors weekly, monthly, or every few months. Subproject TL are approved by the Communications Working Group Leads and one or more other TAG ENV Lead(s) publicly.

- Recommended one Tech Lead (TL) for each subteam

Subteams:

- Social Media - Social Media Coordinator to manage TAG ENVs social media presence and posts
- Blog - Blog Coordinator to manage TAG ENVs blog posts submissions and schedule
- Website - Website Coordinator to manage TAG ENVs website content and in coming changes
- Event - Event Coordinator to manage TAG ENVs in person or virtual meetups
- Contributor Experience - Contributor experience coordinator to manage how the TAG best engages with new contributors

Detailed information about the subteams' operations is described in handbooks.
