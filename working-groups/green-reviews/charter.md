# Green Reviews Working Group Charter

## Introduction

This document outlines the charter for the Green Reviews Working Group, a [CNCF Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/workinggroups/README.md) under the [CNCF TAG Environmental Sustainability](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability).

## Scope

- Act within the CNCF Environmental Sustainability TAG Charter. 
- Provide metrics, guidelines, guidance, and processes for measuring and improving the sustainability footprint of CNCF projects.
- Initiate a CNCF project review at the discretion of the Working Group.
- Utilize existing tooling to conduct CNCF project sustainability footprint reviews.
- Create minimal tooling to conduct CNCF project sustainability footprint reviews, for example, to automate certain processes, if existing tooling does not meet requirements, and if the CNCF Environmental Sustainability TAG formally approved this.
- Be a point of contact for project maintainers to understand the outcome of the projects’ reviews.

## Goals

- Provide resources through a review process and methodology to help CNCF projects to evaluate their sustainability footprint[^1] and integrate environmental sustainability practices. 
- Collaborate with CNCF project maintainers to produce meaningful sustainability footprint reviews.
- Communicate the results of the projects’ cloud native sustainability reviews.


## Non-Goals

- Build tooling for measuring or monitoring sustainability-related metrics from scratch.
- Contribute code to existing tooling and cloud native sustainability projects such as bug fixes or features.
- Providing any consultancy or guidance that goes beyond facilitating the projects’ sustainability footprint reviews.


## Deliverables

- Clarify the concept of sustainability footprint and identify its constituent components across various categories of CNCF projects.
- Document how to conduct the collaborative sustainability footprint review process of a CNCF projects with project maintainers[^2].
- Document methodologies for gathering sustainability-related metrics using existing tooling and provide guidance on how to automate generation of these metrics (for example, into the project's build pipeline) to enable efficient and consistent reviews of the sustainability footprint of CNCF projects.
- Develop testing infrastructure to utilise existing tooling to measure the sustainability footprint of CNCF projects.
- Provide visualisation to communicate the outcomes of the sustainability footprint CNCF project reviews, for example, through dashboards for carbon and energy monitoring.
- Publish the deliverables above on the TAG’s GitHub repository and any other mediums such as the TAG’s website, blog, and others as necessary.
